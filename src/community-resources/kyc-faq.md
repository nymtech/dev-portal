# KYC FAQ

On this page you find important information about participation in community activities which involve NYM token rewards, such as contests, giveaways, and promotions. Before participating in any such activity, make sure to read it carefully. 

# Am I eligible to participate? What are the conditions?

Be nice and play fair! Nym reserves the right to determine the final outcome of its programs and community activities and disqualify any participants without prior notice or recourse for any reason, including fraudulent behavior and failure to adhere to the [Nym Code of Conduct](https://nymtech.net/docs/coc.html).

# I won NYM tokens - what do I do?

First things first: congratulations! We hope you had some fun in the process.

Before receiving your NYM token rewards, you are required to successfully complete KYC verification with Synaps, Nym's KYC provider of choice. You only need to do this once!

1. To receive your rewards, you will need a Nym wallet address - if you don't already have one, [download](https://nymtech.net/download/) the Nym wallet and create an account. You can copy your wallet address from the "receive" tab of the wallet.
2. Drop us an email at [support@nymte.ch](mailto:support@nymte.ch) with the subject line "claiming my rewards for <name of activity>".
3. If you already passed KYC with us earlier, make sure to send the email from your KYC'd email address. You will receive instructions on how to claim your rewards.
4. If this is your first time, your email address will be added to our KYC whitelist and you will receive instructions on how to complete Synaps KYC. Once you successfully completed KYC, your Nym wallet address will be collected, and you will receive instructions on how to claim your rewards.

Please note that after claiming your rewards, it may take up to 3 weeks until you receive them. Keep an eye on your wallet!

# I received my NYM tokens. What can I do with them?

 We're glad you asked! The Nym network is the most robust privacy infrastructure the world has ever seen, and the NYM token is how you can access its [utility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1qrYlyFt48):

* As a user, [unparalleled privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQHF4LkX7M8) for your communications
* As a [mix node operator](https://medium.com/nymtech/nym-mixnodes-deep-dive-d2b91917f097), rewards for your crucial role in operating our decentralized privacy infrastructure
* As a [delegator](https://medium.com/nymtech/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165), rewards for securing the Nym network and ensuring outstanding quality of service

Using the Nym network is free for now, but user fees will be introduced in the future and those will be paid in NYM tokens, so set them aside! And until then, you can contribute to running our decentralized infrastructure and earn mix mining rewards by setting up Nym mix nodes and bonding your tokens to them. You don't need to run nodes to contribute to the security and performance of the Nym network though. You can pledge your trust in someone else's node by delegating your NYM tokens to it, and receive a share of their mix mining rewards.

You can find out more about how staking works in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcNGcTwlm0I) video from our Chief Scientist Claudia Diaz and if you need help setting up your mix node, choosing one to delegate your tokens to, or anything else, our community is there to help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nym) and [Telegram](https://t.me/nymchan).
