# Community Guides

We aren't the only ones writing documentation: the Nym developer community is also a great source of guides and resources, some of which we've included here. If you would like to share any resources with the community, please submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the `nymtech/dev-portal` [repository](https://github.com/nymtech/dev-portal).
