### I won NYM tokens. How can I claim them?

First things first: congratulations! We hope you had some fun in the process. A Nym Community Manger tagged you on Telegram or Discord - send them a private message start the claiming process. You will receive your unique reward ID and detailed instructions on how to use it to claim your rewards. **Remember: we never DM you first!**

**Note: you have 2 weeks to claim your tokens! If we don't hear from you, your reward ID will expire.**

### Do I need KYC?

Before receiving NYM token rewards, you are required to successfully complete KYC verification with Synaps, Nymâ€™s KYC provider of choice. You only need to do this once! 

### This is my first time - How do I pass KYC?

To claim your rewards, you will be asked to provide your email address. If you haven't passed KYC yet, your email address will be added to our KYC whitelist and you will receive a welcome email from Synaps with instructions on how to start the KYC process. Once you complete KYC and provide a valid Nym wallet address, your rewards will be transferred to you automatically.

To receive your tokens, you will need a Nym wallet address. If you don't already have one, [download](https://nymtech.net/download/) the Nym wallet and create an account. You can copy your wallet address from the "receive" tab of the wallet. 

**Note: it may take up to 2 weeks for your email address to get whitelisted. Be patient and keep an eye on your inbox!**

**Tip: If you are unsure if you've completed our KYC before, visit our Synaps KYC portal and try to log in.**

### I already passed KYC previously. What do I need to do?

If you successfully completed KYC earlier and provided your Nym wallet address too, you are all set - just claim your rewards and they will be transferred to you. 

**Note: after claiming your NYM tokens, it may take up to 3 weeks until they are transferred to your wallet. Be patient and keep an eye on your wallet!**

### I received my NYM tokens. What can I do with them?

 We're glad you asked! The Nym network is the most robust privacy infrastructure the world has ever seen, and the NYM token is how you can access its [utility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1qrYlyFt48):

* As a user, [unparalleled privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQHF4LkX7M8) for your communications
* As a [mix node operator](https://medium.com/nymtech/nym-mixnodes-deep-dive-d2b91917f097), rewards for your crucial role in operating our decentralized privacy infrastructure
* As a [delegator](https://medium.com/nymtech/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165), rewards for securing the Nym network and ensuring outstanding quality of service

Using the Nym network is free for now, but user fees will be introduced in the future and those will be paid in NYM tokens, so set them aside! And until then, you can contribute to running our decentralized infrastructure and earn mix mining rewards by setting up Nym mix nodes and bonding your tokens to them. You don't need to run nodes to contribute to the security and performance of the Nym network though. You can pledge your trust in someone else's node by delegating your NYM tokens to it, and receive a share of their mix mining rewards.

You can find out more about how staking works in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcNGcTwlm0I) video from our Chief Scientist Claudia Diaz and if you need help setting up your mix node, choosing one to delegate your tokens to, or anything else, our community is there to help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nym) and [Telegram](https://t.me/nymchan).
