# Building a Simple Service Provider

>This tutorial was built and tested using Node version `v16.14.0`. We recommend using this version as a minimum.

This tutorial is the best place to start for developers new to Nym. You will learn how to build a minimum viable privacy-enabled application (PEApp) able to send and receive traffic via the mixnet.

This tutorial is less about building an immediately useful application, and more about beginning to understand:
* Sending messages through the mixnet to another Nym client  
* Receiving messages from the mixnet and handling them 
* Anonymous replies with Single Use Reply Blocks (SURBs)

That said, this tutorial will give you the skeleton of an application, onto which you can add more useful functionality.
